# Chinese Pīnyīn to English Dictionary: A Fully Pīnyīn-Focused Resource for Kindle E-Readers

This dictionary is the result of one month of full-time software wrangling, frustration, dedication, and love for the Pīnyīn writing system. It's available on Gumroad — for your convenience, and as a reward for my efforts. There you can purchase the ready-to-use Kindle dictionary and download it instantly:

If you prefer the DIY route — whether you're a curious tinkerer or a budget-conscious student — the full source files are available here on GitHub. I've released them under the GPLv3 license, which closely aligns with the spirit of the CC BY-SA 3.0 license used by the CC-CEDICT project, which served as the data source for the Chinese Pīnyīn to English dictionary.

To compile the `.mobi` file yourself, open a terminal, navigate to the `dict_data` directory, and run:

```bash
kindlegen ./pinyin_dictionary.opf
